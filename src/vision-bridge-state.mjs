// The whole ladder Codex knows, not one model's slice of it: which levels are
// really on offer is the engine's own declaration, checked where the request is
// built. This list only keeps a hand-edited state file from smuggling in a

//
//   no file      -- nobody has ever answered. Takes the current default.

//                   verbatim, forever. A stored `false` is never re-enabled by
//                   a change of default; that is the whole point of writing it.
//   unreadable   -- a file exists, so somebody was here, but this build cannot
//                   tell what they chose. Falls back to off, not to the default.
//
// That is why the version stays 1. A bumped version would have to guess what a
// v1 `false` meant, and there is nothing to guess with: file presence already
// separates "never configured" from "configured off", and `visionBridgeConfigured()`
// has been the installer's gate on exactly that distinction since the bridge
// shipped. A migration could only replace a fact with an inference.
