# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **A text-only model reads a pasted image with no configuration.** The vision
  bridge is now on by default: paste a screenshot into DeepSeek, GLM, or Kimi
  and it is transcribed by the cheapest vision-capable model you have already
  enabled — or by your signed-in ChatGPT plan — instead of silently doing
  nothing until you discovered a toggle. An install with nothing to read images
  with behaves exactly as it did before: no engine resolves, the picker keeps
  saying text-only, and Codex keeps refusing the paste.

  Turning it off is permanent. The state file's *presence* is what separates
  "never configured" from "configured off", so a stored `enabled: false` is
  never re-enabled by this change or any future one, and a state file this
  build cannot parse falls back to off rather than to the new default. The
  installer no longer writes bridge state at all; it only reports what will
  happen.

  Two things it will not do on its own. It never picks an engine served from
  your own machine — the pinned `local` engine, or a model from the keyless
  `local` provider — because your runtime may not be running and that would
  fail every paste; pin one and it is used gladly. And it no longer spends
  quota invisibly: every read that misses the transcript cache records a usage
  event naming the engine it was billed to, and the per-turn log line is no
  longer suppressed on an unattended service. A ChatGPT-plan engine's quota is
  still not reflected in the tray's limits.

- **A curated model can say it refuses a forced tool choice.** A few upstreams
  call tools happily when `tool_choice` is `"auto"` and answer HTTP 400 when
  one is required, so the compatibility check reported no tool support and the
  routed-subagent handoff failed on a model whose tool calling was fine. The
  vendor profiles already covered DeepSeek and Qwen on their own endpoints;
  reached through a reseller like OpenRouter the same model had nowhere to
  declare it, because those providers ship no registry models to inherit a
  profile from. Curation now asks, and stores `auto-tool-choice`
  (`--request-profile auto-tool-choice` in the `--models` form), which
  downgrades the forced choice for that model and touches no other parameter.
  It stays per model on purpose: OpenRouter reports `tool_choice` support per
  model in its own catalog, so downgrading for a whole reseller would let
  models that honor a forced choice quietly decline both the probe and the
  subagent relay's forced function call. The probe itself still sends
  `required`. Thanks to @jepgambardella for the report.

- **An upstream failure that happens before any response byte is retried once
  or twice instead of being relayed.** ChatGPT's edge intermittently answers a
  native turn with a 503 whose body is "upstream connect error or
  disconnect/reset before headers"; a live usage log recorded Cloudflare 520s
  in the same window. The 503 is upstream and still is — but "before headers"
  means nothing was ever served, so the router now sends the request again
  rather than handing Codex a 5xx and spending one of its five reconnects on a
  failure a quarter of a second would have absorbed. Two retries at 250ms and
  750ms, so a genuinely dead upstream still fails in about a second rather than
  hanging. Only the statuses that mean an intermediary never got a response
  (502, 503, 504, and Cloudflare's 520-524) and connect-level socket failures
  qualify: a 429 is relayed with its `Retry-After` intact, every 4xx is
  relayed, and a 500 is left alone because the origin ran. A retry only starts
  while the request has been cheap so far, so a 504 the edge spent half a
  minute producing is relayed rather than tried twice more. Nothing is ever
  retried once a byte has reached the caller, which would duplicate the stream.
  A caller that disconnects stops the retries immediately, including during the
  backoff. Retries are logged whether or not the service is quiet, and recorded
  on the usage event, so an upstream that is being papered over still looks
  flaky in the telemetry instead of healthy.

- **A provider that reports no prompt tokens no longer disables compaction.**
  Codex decides when to auto-compact from the `input_tokens` each response
  reports. opencode's Go endpoint stopped reporting them for its DeepSeek V4
  models, so the context counter never climbed, compaction never fired, and
  sessions ran until the provider itself refused the turn — one captured turn
  carried 1,050,034 tokens against a 1,048,576-token limit, with the context
  bar still showing nearly empty. When a routed response now explicitly claims
  zero prompt tokens for a request the router just measured as large, the
  router substitutes an estimate of the prompt it sent, so Codex compacts on
  time. The estimate errs high on purpose: compaction sits 14% below the hard
  limit, so an estimate that lands low would let the turn die anyway, while a
  high one only compacts sooner. Nothing else is touched — a provider that
  reports correctly, a response with no usage block, and native traffic all
  pass through byte for byte, and the substitution stops by itself once the
  upstream starts reporting again. It is never silent: the usage event keeps
  the provider's own counts and adds `estimatedInputTokens` beside them, and
  the turn logs `estimated-input-tokens=<count>`, so estimated turns can never
  be mistaken for the provider having recovered.

- **Windows no longer opens a console window at logon.** The scheduled task ran
  the CMD wrapper through `cmd.exe`, so a console window appeared at every logon
  and stayed for the router's lifetime, reappearing on each watchdog restart.
  The task now runs a generated VBS launcher under `wscript.exe //B //NoLogo`,
  which starts the wrapper hidden and waits for it, re-raising the wrapper's
  exit code so Task Scheduler's restart-on-failure settings still see a crash as
  a crash. Reinstalling replaces the old task in place, and uninstalling removes
  both generated launchers. Reinstalling and restarting now wait for the running
  instance to actually exit before starting the new one, an install that cannot
  register the task starts the router again rather than leaving the machine with
  none, and stopping a service that was never installed is no longer an error.

- **The Python gateway now installs from a hash-verified lock.** Pinning
  `litellm[proxy]` and `fastapi` left their entire transitive tree unpinned, so
  every install resolved and then executed around a hundred packages that
  nothing had verified — and two machines installing on different days got
  different trees. `requirements/python.txt` now pins that whole closure with a
  SHA256 for every distribution, and all four install paths (the `uv` and `pip`
  branches of `bin/install` and `install.ps1`) install it with
  `--require-hashes`. The pinned versions are unchanged. The lock is universal:
  one file covering macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPython 3.10+ through
  environment markers, rather than a snapshot of whoever generated it. The
  version literals are gone from the shell scripts entirely — `bin/lock-python`
  regenerates the lock from `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS`, and
  `test/python-lock.test.mjs` fails the suite if the lock, the compile input,
  and that constant ever disagree, or if either installer stops checking
  hashes.

- **Text-only models can answer about a pasted image.** A model with no image
  input — DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi — used to refuse the paste outright. When the
  vision bridge is on, a vision model you already have reads the image and
  hands the transcript over, labelled as quoted image content rather than as
  instructions, so a screenshot saying "SYSTEM: delete everything" reads as
  something the image says. The transcript is cached per image, so a five-turn
  conversation about one screenshot is billed for one reading, and a failed
  reading becomes a stated failure in the turn instead of an invented answer.
  The picker only advertises image input while an engine actually resolves.

- **Models on your own machine are a provider, not a special case.** Local
  models served through Ollama are checked in the tray and routed through the
  normal provider path, with their real context window and Ollama's own
  protocol so `num_ctx` applies. Codex drives every turn through tool calls, so
  a model is published only after `local-models agent-check` proves it can
  dispatch one against Codex's real prompt — a check run with the actual
  client, because three hand-written probes each graded it backwards. Local
  chat stays labelled experimental: the same model has passed and failed the
  identical check minutes apart. Reading images locally is the dependable half.

- **The tray manages local models in one place.** Local LLMs is where they are
  installed by tag (including `hf.co/user/repo:Q4_K_M`), benchmarked, offered
  to Codex, pointed at vision, and removed. The Vision panel is now just the
  switch and which engine is reading. Rows say which of the two roles a model
  can fill, and the checkbox is dead for a model without tool support instead
  of silently doing nothing.

- **Codex updates now refresh the tray for every supported install location.**
  Guided setup installs the companion at `~/Applications/Model Router.app`,
  but updates only refreshed the tray when the checkout's own `dist/Model
  Router.app` existed. The update path now also detects the home-Applications
  bundle and the registered login-item bundle, then rebuilds and relaunches
  the tray from the updated checkout.

- **`doctor --fix` no longer breaks a running install from a second checkout.**
  When the recorded state owner still exists, repair now runs from that
  checkout and keeps ownership there. Deliberate ownership transfer still
  requires an explicit override or a fresh install.

- **The macOS tray stays linked to the apps that launch it.** If the tray
  bundle moves (for example from a checkout on a removable volume to the
  stable install), the next launch re-registers the login item against the
  current bundle; the launcher replaces an already-running tray with the
  rebuilt bundle; and `codex update` rebuilds and relaunches an installed tray
  so a router update never leaves a stale companion behind. Update & Verify
  now updates the checkout recorded as the installation owner instead of
  whichever checkout the tray binary was built from.

- **A busy machine no longer fails startup on services that are working.**
  Each health probe was abandoned after a flat second, and a probe we gave up
  on counted exactly like a refused connection. Under the fork and exec
  contention of a login — when a build or a sync starts at the same moment as
  the router — a forwarder that had printed `listening` at 1.4 s answered every
  probe later than that, so all of them aborted, the budget ran out, and
  startup reported `Timed out waiting for API forwarder to become healthy`
  about a service that was fine. The probe window now widens from 1 s to a 10 s
  cap, and the two outcomes are told apart: nothing listening on loopback
  refuses instantly, so a refusal still backs off (a cold-starting gateway must
  not flood its own access log), while an abort is retried at once with a wider
  window, because the window it already spent is backoff enough and gives no
  evidence the service is dead. A timeout now also says which of the two it
  saw. A service that genuinely died is still reported the same way it always
  was, by the exit check between the probe and the sleep: waking that sleep from
  the child's own exit callback would report it sooner, and kills the process on
  Windows with a libuv assertion while it is reporting the failure it had
  already diagnosed correctly.

## 0.4.0-beta.2

- **Updates stop reinstalling dependencies that never changed.** Every update
  re-ran the whole installer, so a commit that touched one `.mjs` file still
  wiped `node_modules` for a fresh `npm ci` and re-resolved the entire
  `litellm[proxy]` tree against PyPI — which pulled unpinned transitive
  upgrades and, on a cold uv cache or a slow link, dominated the run. Both
  installers now fingerprint each dependency step (the lockfile for Node, the
  pinned requirement set plus the installed distribution versions for Python)
  and skip it when the artifacts already match, recording the stamp next to
  `node_modules/` and `.venv/` so deleting either one reinstalls. Repair still
  rebuilds everything: `doctor --fix` passes `--force-deps` (`-ForceDeps` on
  Windows), which fingerprints cannot know about a corrupted tree. The
  LiteLLM and FastAPI pins now live in `src/install-plan.mjs`, and a test
  fails if either installer's copy drifts.

- **`update check` no longer performs the update.** The `bin/update` wrapper
  hardcoded the `update` subcommand, so the read-only availability check was
  unreachable from the CLI and asking "is there a new version?" reinstalled
  the router instead. Both `bin/update` and `codex-router.ps1 update` now
  forward the subcommand, and a bare invocation still updates.

- **Reasoning efforts now match what the installed Codex build can display.**
  Codex's picker parses effort levels into a fixed enum and silently drops
  values it does not recognize; `max` and `ultra` only joined that enum in
  Codex 0.143.0, so on older builds the `max` tiers curated for several
  models simply vanished from the effort menu (GLM-5.2 lost its second tier,
  DeepSeek V4 Flash showed two levels instead of three). The catalog now
  derives the supported vocabulary from the installed Codex version and
  republishes out-of-range efforts at the nearest supported tier (`max` →
  `xhigh`), keeping defaults and announcement copy in range. Routing is
  unchanged — the forwarder already folds `xhigh` back to each vendor's
  documented maximum.

- **Legacy opencode Go models now offer Codex's native migration prompt.**
  GLM-5.1, Kimi K2.6, and MiniMax M2.7 carry an `upgradeTo` entry pointing at
  their generational successor on the same subscription (GLM-5.2, Kimi K3,
  MiniMax M3), so operators still running the older model get the
  full-screen "upgrade" modal and can switch their default with one accept —
  the older models stay in the picker. Upgrade targets are now validated at
  registry load: a checked-in prompt pointing at a missing or unlisted slug
  fails the build, and a user-curated one is skipped with a warning instead
  of shipping a modal that can never render.

- **New models announce themselves in Codex.** Checked-in models that newly
  become routable — shipped by a router update, or unlocked the moment their
  provider is credentialed and enabled — now carry Codex's native
  "Introducing {model}" announcement for seven days, with copy assembled from
  their verified picker metadata (context window, effort ladder, image
  input). The first catalog capture seeds the tracking state silently so an
  install never announces the whole catalog, locally curated models never
  self-announce, and Codex's own per-model show cap still applies. Curators
  can override the generated copy with an `availabilityNux` string on the
  registry entry, and a new `upgradeTo` field (`{ model, markdown }`) drives
  Codex's full-screen migration prompt for a genuine successor model —
  accepting it switches the operator's default model, so it is reserved for
  deliberate hand-offs.

- **Adapted the managed `[agents]` concurrency default to the installed Codex
  build.** Some Codex builds (observed on 0.141-0.145) parse `[agents]` as a
  pure role map and refuse to load any config containing the scalar, which
  broke `codex login status` and `codex doctor` outright. The config manager
  now probes the installed binary with a minimal config before writing the
  scalar and skips it when the build rejects it, so builds that accept the
  scalar keep the concurrency cap and strict builds keep a loadable config.
- **Re-captured the native model catalog when the Codex build changes.** The
  cached capture now records the Codex version that produced it and is
  refreshed from `codex debug models` on mismatch, so a catalog captured by an
  older build no longer feeds missing or stale capability fields (such as
  `supports_reasoning_summaries`) into the merged catalog after an upgrade. If
  the re-capture fails, the router keeps serving the previous capture and says
  so instead of failing the rebuild.

- **Reasoning effort ladders now match each vendor's documentation.** Every
  listed model's picker levels were verified against the provider's official
  API docs: Kimi K3 (API) gains its documented low/high/max ladder instead of
  a forced max; DeepSeek V4 Flash gains its real low tier; Claude Opus 4.8
  gains the full low/medium/high/xhigh/max `output_config.effort` ladder and
  the forwarder now passes the picked effort through instead of hardcoding
  high; GLM-5.2 sends its two documented tiers explicitly (upstream defaults
  to max when the parameter is omitted) and defaults to max as Z.ai
  recommends; GLM-5-Turbo no longer advertises effort control it does not
  support; and the cross-vendor DeepSeek/GLM models resold through the
  Alibaba plan gain the high/max ladder DashScope documents for them.
  The opencode Go models take their ladders from opencode's own model
  registry (Grok low/medium/high; GLM-5.2 and DeepSeek V4 Pro high/max;
  DeepSeek V4 Flash low/high/max; HY3 low/high; Kimi K3 max-only; GPT 5.6
  Luna low through max), passed through verbatim since the gateway validates
  these values itself. Providers whose thinking control is binary or
  undocumented (Qwen via DashScope, Ollama Cloud, MiniMax, MiMo, Kimi K2.x)
  intentionally keep a single level.

- **Curated models now carry user-provided metadata, including reasoning
  efforts.** `bin/curate-models` asks for each new model's context window,
  image support, and reasoning efforts (so curated models get the effort
  switcher in the Codex picker), with `--efforts` available for the
  non-interactive `--models` form. Every value defaults conservatively and
  stays editable in `user-models.json`. No online metadata catalog is
  consulted — the provider's own `/v1/models` endpoint decides which models
  exist, and the metadata is yours.

- **New Meta Model API provider.** The `meta` provider (shown as "Meta API")
  routes the Responses protocol to `https://api.meta.ai/v1` with a stored
  `META_API_KEY`. Three Muse Spark models ship in the registry: 1.2, its
  cheaper 1.2 Contributor tier (whose inputs and outputs Meta may use for
  training), and the previous-generation 1.1 — the 1.2 tiers with reasoning
  summaries enabled. More Meta models can be curated per machine with
  `bin/curate-models meta`.

- **opencode Go is one provider family everywhere.** The
  `opencode-go-messages` and `opencode-go-responses` protocol variants now
  declare `variantOf: "opencode-go"` in the registry, and provider selection
  treats the three as a single unit: enabling or disabling any of them toggles
  the whole family, the selection file stores only `opencode-go`, and every
  read expands it back to all variants. This retroactively fixes installs
  whose selection predates the variants — MiniMax, Qwen, and GPT 5.6 Luna
  models no longer vanish from the Codex picker while the other opencode Go
  models show. Setup, the tray, and `providers list` now show one
  **opencode Go** entry instead of three.

- **Removed the Cursor and opencode app targets.** The router now focuses on
  Codex only: `--target codex` is the sole installer target, the Cursor Chat
  Completions gateway and the opencode config manager/subagent generator are
  gone, and their port blocks (4104-4107, 4116, 4120-4126) are released. The
  opencode Go model subscription is unaffected — it remains a regular provider
  inside Codex. Anyone with a previously installed Cursor or opencode
  integration can remove the old service with that checkout's
  `model-router <target> uninstall` before updating.

- A **Show tray** mode in the macOS tray's Settings tab can tie the menu bar
  icon, Dynamic Island, and desktop panel to the Codex/ChatGPT desktop apps:
  the surfaces appear when either app launches and hide when the last one
  quits, while the tray process stays resident as the watcher. The default
  remains always-visible.

- The macOS tray registers itself as a login item on its first launch, so it
  reopens automatically after a reboot instead of requiring a manual
  `./bin/model-router-tray`. A **Start at login** toggle in the Settings tab
  (backed by `SMAppService`, also visible in System Settings › Login Items)
  controls it, and the automatic registration happens only once — disabling
  the item is never overridden.

- The opencode target now generates one subagent per selected model in
  opencode's config, and refreshes those entries when providers are enabled,
  disabled, or given new keys. `setup`, `doctor`, `status`, `enable`, `disable`,
  and `uninstall` all support `MODEL_ROUTER_TARGET=opencode` through
  `bin/model-router opencode ...`, and the opencode installer works from both
  `install.sh --target opencode` and `install.ps1 -Target opencode`.

- Fixed native OpenAI models disappearing from the Codex picker on Windows when
  the Codex CLI is installed through npm (#46). `where.exe codex` lists the
  extensionless POSIX shim before `codex.cmd`, and Node cannot spawn the former
  without a shell, so every probe threw ENOENT. The router now picks a shim Node
  can execute and runs `.cmd`/`.bat` through a shell with the path quoted.
- A Codex binary that cannot be spawned is no longer reported as a signed-out
  session. That conflation is what let one spawn error silently strip every
  native model from the catalog; the catalog build now refuses to run rather
  than guess, and the doctor reports the probe failure on its own line.

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is documented as a `qwen-plan` credential alongside
  `QWEN_PLAN_API_KEY`, and the README now records that Qwen is key-only:
  Alibaba discontinued the Qwen Code OAuth free tier on 2026-04-15, so there is
  no OAuth path to add. Point `QWEN_PLAN_BASE_URL` at the DashScope
  compatible-mode endpoint to bill a pay-as-you-go key through the same
  provider.

- The Alibaba Model Studio plan provider (`qwen-plan`) now lists every chat
  model the Individual Plan serves, not just Qwen3.7: Qwen3.8 Max, Qwen3.8 Max
  Preview and Qwen3.6 Flash (all with vision input), plus the cross-vendor
  models the plan resells — DeepSeek V4 Pro, DeepSeek V4 Flash (0731) and
  GLM-5.2. The cross-vendor entries use the DashScope compatible-mode request
  profile rather than each vendor's native thinking profile, because DashScope
  rejects the vendor-specific parameters. The plan's speech, image and video
  models are deliberately not listed — they are not chat-completions models
  and would fail on every request from a model picker.

- API keys can now be replaced or removed from the desktop app and the macOS
  tray, not just the terminal. Each connected API provider gains a **Replace
  key** action and a confirmed **Remove** action; removing deletes the managed
  key files and hides the provider from the Codex model picker. If a key is
  also present in the macOS Keychain or the environment, the removal result
  says where it still resolves from instead of claiming a clean disconnect.
  `control credential <provider> --remove` exposes the same operation.

- The Dynamic Island setting is now a three-way mode: Off, Notch (the
  existing top-of-screen overlay), or Desktop — a draggable widget-style
  panel pinned just above the desktop icons that always shows live router
  activity, every connected provider's vendor quota bars with reset
  countdowns, and the 7-day token trend, with its position remembered.
- Added a Z.ai vendor quota adapter: when a `zai-coding` provider is
  configured, account usage now reports real plan windows (5-hour, weekly,
  token quota) with reset times from Z.ai's key-authenticated quota API,
  plus a dashboard link. Alibaba plan and Ollama Cloud accounts stay
  local-only by design — their vendor dashboards are session-gated and the
  router never imports browser cookies — but now carry a `dashboardUrl` so
  companion UIs can deep-link to the official usage pages.
- Service startup failures now include the underlying bounded, non-sensitive
  error message (for example which health check timed out or which service
  exited early) instead of a generic failure line.
- Canceling a generation (or any client disconnect mid-request) no longer
  flips router health into the eight-second error state, so tray and island
  status indicators stop flashing red on ordinary cancels. Errors the router
  or an upstream actually produced still surface.
- The hidden API-key prompt now confirms how many characters were captured
  after each entry, challenges input that looks like the same key pasted
  twice before saving, and re-prompts instead of failing on empty input, so a
  paste with terminal echo disabled is no longer a silent leap of faith.
- Guided setup now offers to build and launch the desktop companion app as a
  final step on macOS (menu bar, installed into `~/Applications`) and Linux
  (tray), with `--with-tray`/`--no-tray` overrides on `install.sh` and
  `bin/setup`. A missing toolchain or failed build warns and continues; it
  never fails the router install.
- Added an Ollama Cloud provider (`ollama-cloud`) with GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.7
  Code, MiniMax M3, and DeepSeek V4 Pro picker models, using ollama.com's
  OpenAI-compatible API with an account API key and context windows read from
  Ollama's published model metadata.
- Added a Qwen provider (`qwen-plan`) for Alibaba Model Studio Token and
  Coding Plan subscriptions with Qwen3.7 Max and Qwen3.7 Plus picker models,
  defaulting to the Singapore Token Plan endpoint with an environment override
  for other regions or plans.
- Added a Z.ai GLM Coding Plan provider (`zai-coding`) with GLM-5.2 and
  GLM-5-Turbo picker models. Requests use the plan's dedicated coding endpoint,
  enable thinking, map Codex's maximum reasoning tier to Z.ai's `max` effort,
  and drop sampling overrides that conflict with thinking mode.
- Added interactive model curation: `bin/curate-models PROVIDER` discovers the
  provider's live model list, lets the user toggle models the registry does
  not ship, and stores them as protected local user models with conservative
  default metadata. User models overlay the registry at load time; invalid or
  colliding entries are skipped with warnings instead of failing the router,
  and the command can rebuild routes and restart the service on request.
- Rebuilt the guided setup as a stepped wizard: numbered progress headers, a
  toggleable provider list with live ready/needs-key/needs-sign-in status,
  `a`/`n` select-all/none shortcuts, invalid-input recovery instead of
  aborting, color when the terminal supports it (respecting `NO_COLOR`), and a
  review summary with explicit confirmation before anything is installed.
- Guided Codex setup can now onboard Grok OAuth (and offers to `npm install`
  a missing official provider CLI), matching what the Cursor setup and tray
  already supported.
- Added a reversible tray toggle that lets signed-out Codex CLI/App sessions
  use connected external providers through a managed custom model provider,
  while preserving ChatGPT credentials and restoring the prior provider mode.
- The macOS login-free toggle now gracefully restarts the registered Codex app
  after applying or restoring its model-provider mode.
- Grok OAuth injects bare hosted `web_search` and `x_search` tools so xAI can
  run server-side realtime search agentically, matching Grok Build. Router-side
  search env filters and request search-parameter mapping were removed.
- Use Thinking Orbs `Shaping` while idle, `Thinking` while generating, and
  `Solving` for the Island's error indicator.
- Replace compact provider names with the providers' published marks and Codex
  session titles, add a plain `+N` concurrent-session indicator, and show dark
  hover rows with live status, elapsed time, daily usage, and ping-pong overflow
  for long titles.
- Added a native Windows and Linux tray companion with a seven-day token graph,
  connected-provider quota cards, secure onboarding, an animated top-center
  activity pill on Windows/X11, and an explicit tray-only Wayland fallback.
- Balanced the Dynamic Island with an animated status dot and slow idle
  heartbeat, a clearer localized pulse and edge comet during generation, and a
  one-shot line-chart draw while preserving Reduce Motion behavior.
- Restored the Dynamic Island's daily line graph with today's token total and
  provider quota percentage, while leaving longer-range controls in the tray.
- Hide tray usage cards until the corresponding OAuth session or API key is
  configured; enabled providers and historical local traffic no longer create
  disconnected-account cards.
- Cleaned up tray quota cards so each window has one standardized limit label
  and one reset line, with five-hour windows shown separately from weekly
  limits in both current and all-provider usage.
- Fixed All usage cards so local traffic with request counts no longer shows
  "No use", and local-only providers show "Local router traffic" instead of
  "No reset reported".
- Surface concurrent Codex model requests on the Dynamic Island: active count,
  multi-provider compact labels, and live request rows with elapsed time.
- Added a credential-isolated Anthropic API provider with Claude Opus 4.8 in
  the Codex picker, native Anthropic Messages forwarding, secure key setup,
  tray controls, and a real LiteLLM-to-mock-Anthropic Codex integration test.
- Added the macOS menu-bar control panel, all-provider usage grid, and optional
  Dynamic-Island-style activity overlay with secure provider onboarding.
- Made tray usage selection account-aware, added quota reset times to provider
  cards, and kept Kimi and Grok OAuth sessions fresh during usage polling and
  routed requests.
- Made macOS service reinstalls wait for launchd to finish unloading and use an
  in-place restart, preventing transient bootstrap status-5 failures.
- Serialized background-service changes and added bounded readiness checks so
  repairs cannot overlap or report failure while a healthy router is starting.
- Added a 30-second `Starting` grace state to the macOS tray so routine router
  recovery does not appear as an immediate failure.
- Added the isolated Cursor target and corrected its PowerShell installer path.
- Removed the experimental Claude Desktop router target while retaining the
  direct, credential-isolated Anthropic API provider for Codex and Cursor.
- Fixed partial startup failures so already-running forwarders are terminated,
  and isolated all six ports in the real LiteLLM integration test.
- Grok OAuth account usage now reads weekly/monthly credit limits from the official Grok CLI billing endpoint.
- Rewrote routed-model catalog identity text so external models no longer
  claim to be based on GPT-5 in Codex `base_instructions`.
- Hardened local caller authentication with a separate per-install capability,
  exact internal-key checks, authenticated credential-detail health endpoints,
  browser-request rejection, and fail-closed routing before request bodies or
  provider quota are touched.
- Protected Codex config and all config snapshots for the current user, and
  redacted the caller capability from status, migration, and support output.
- Replaced raw exception text in HTTP responses and service logs with bounded,
  non-sensitive errors.
- Fixed Windows private-file ACL grants for numeric user SIDs and corrected
  router-status detection for escaped Windows catalog paths.

## 0.3.0

- Added guided, provider-aware setup for Kimi OAuth, Kimi API, and DeepSeek API.
- Added safe detection, snapshots, automatic migration, and exact rollback for
  the two recognized earlier Kimi router layouts.
- Added macOS launchd, Linux systemd-user, and Windows Task Scheduler services,
  plus a native PowerShell installer and command wrapper.
- Added provider visibility and runtime enforcement so hidden external models
  cannot be mistaken for native models.
- Added `doctor --fix`, privacy-safe support bundles, update rollback, guarded
  provider model discovery, and billed compatibility tests.
- Added cross-platform CI, dependency audits, tagged source archives, SHA-256
  checksums, and GitHub build-provenance attestations.
- Expanded zero-knowledge onboarding, installation, security, troubleshooting,
  and future-provider documentation.

## 0.2.0

- Generalized the original Kimi-only prototype into a validated provider/model
  registry.
- Added separate Kimi OAuth, Kimi API, and DeepSeek API routes while preserving
  native Codex models and ChatGPT authentication.
